            <strong>This was a simulated phishing test conducted by the ITSolutions IT Security Department.</strong> You are seeing this page because you clicked on a link in a simulated phishing email and submitted information through the form.
        </div>

        <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
        <p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers disguise themselves as trustworthy entities in order to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or other personal information. These attacks often come through emails, text messages, or fake websites.</p>

        <div class="phishing-example">
            <h3>How This Test Worked</h3>
            <p>The email you received was designed to mimic common phishing tactics used by real attackers. By identifying what techniques were used, you can better protect yourself in the future:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sender's email address appeared to be from "security@itsolutions.com" but wasn't from our actual domain</li>
                <li>The subject line "Your Account Requires Immediate Attention" created a false sense of urgency</li>
                <li>The message claimed there was "suspicious activity" to prompt immediate action through fear</li>
                <li>The email contained a "Verify Your Account" link that directed to a fake ITSolutions login page</li>
                <li>The landing page asked for your email and password details so that attackers could use them to access your real accounts</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>How to Identify Phishing Attempts</h2>
        <div class="tips-container">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check the sender's email address</strong> - Look carefully at the domain name (the part after @) to ensure it's legitimate.</li>
                <li><strong>Be suspicious of urgent requests</strong> - Phishers often create a false sense of urgency to make you act quickly without thinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Hover over links before clicking</strong> - This reveals the actual URL where you'll be directed.</li>
                <li><strong>Be wary of unexpected attachments</strong> - Don't open attachments you weren't expecting, even if they appear to come from someone you know.</li>
                <li><strong>Look for poor grammar or spelling</strong> - Many phishing attempts contain obvious errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Never share sensitive information via email</strong> - Legitimate organisations rarely ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information through email.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>What Should You Do If You Suspect a Phishing Attempt?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not click on any links or download any attachments</li>
            <li>Report the suspicious email to IT Security immediately at <strong>security@itsolutions.com</strong></li>
            <li>Delete the email from your inbox</li>
            <li>If you've already clicked a link or shared information, contact IT Security right away and change your passwords</li>
        </ul>
